# Mastering Shiny Solutions

This book contains my solutions to the exercises in Hadley Wickhamâ€™s book [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html). It was created as a workbook and resource for myself. 

If you are looking for more reliable solutions, I would recommend another [manual](https://mastering-shiny-solutions.org/) created by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti.
