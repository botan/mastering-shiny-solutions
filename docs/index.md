# Welcome {-}

This book contains my solutions to the exercises in Hadley Wickham’s book [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html). It was set up as a workbook and resource for myself. If you are looking for more reliable solutions, I would recommend another [manual](https://mastering-shiny-solutions.org/) created by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti.

## Colophon {-}

This book was written in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using [**bookdown**](http://bookdown.org/). The [website](https://botan.github.io/mastering-shiny-solutions/) is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/botan/mastering-shiny-solutions).

This version of the book was built with R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) and the following packages:
